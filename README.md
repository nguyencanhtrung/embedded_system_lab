####1. Description<a id="part1"></a>
   **_Embedded system lab_** includes _4 warm-up assignments_ and _1 final project_.
   Through the lab, students are going to:
   - Learn about architecture of an embedded system, know how components in an embedded system communicate.
   - Make decision of hardware/software partition to achieve specific requirements.
   - Design peripheral controllers in VHDL and integrate them into the system.
   - Writing assembler software to perform specific tasks.
